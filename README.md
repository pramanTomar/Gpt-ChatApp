# Gpt-ChatApp
This web app can be used as normal chatting app 
It is a chat app along with the power of openai.      
I have integrated openai api's in this chat app using which the user can ask any query to the bot and get answers accordingly.  

The user can make different chat rooms for different functionalities such as,  
-> A chat room prefixed with AI_Chat can be used to chat with the AI_Bot.  
-> A chat room prefixed with AI_Code can be used to get help as a coding partner.  
-> A chat room prefixed with AI_Assist can be used to get help with sentence completion.  
-> Any other chat room prefix would make it a standard chat room.
